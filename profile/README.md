We are a group of neuroscientists and engineers who are interested in understanding the neuronal basis of behavior. Our lab uses a variety of techniques, including  optogenetics, and behavior experiments to study how the brain controls and modulates behavior.

## Research Focus

Our Group is interested in identifying and characterizing neuronal networks in the brain.

Our focus lies in:
- Using recombinant rabies virus and light-sheet fluorescence microscopy to study neuronal networks at cellular and sub-cellular resolution
- Using optogenetic tools and behavior paradigms to study function of identified circuits
- olfactory behaviors and epileptic disease models

We are committed to advancing the field of neuroscience through open and reproducible science. To that end, we have developed a number of open-source solutions to facilitate the conduct of closed-loop, behavior-dependent experiments in real-time. These include tools for:

- Running closed-loop experiments [DLStream](https://github.com/SchwarzNeuroconLab/DeepLabStream)
- Classifying behavior based on pose estimation using active learning [A-SOiD](https://github.com/YttriLab/A-SOID)

## Getting Involved

We welcome contributions from the scientific community. If you are interested in collaborating with us or using our tools in your own research, please don't hesitate to contact us.
